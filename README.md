# Eye-Movement-Exercise
This is a project that shows a pair of eyes that track the mouse cursor on the screen.
to run this file, please download all components into your device and open the HTML file using a web browser.
Future improvements to the exercise would be including a functioning button that disable tracking on one of the eyes. so you could choose which eye is following the cursor, or you would have the option to keep it as it is.
